<p>My name is Andrew Zimmerman.  I am currently teaching myself Basic Web Development through Udemy's fantastic courses.  I have basic experience in HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap and am now learning Javascript before I move onto the backend side of things.  I am teaching myself to code so I can eventually get a remote development job in my world traveling life.</p>
